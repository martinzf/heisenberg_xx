# HEISENBERG XX

### ABOUT

Heisenberg XX model, miscellaneous documentation and calculations. Essentially a rewriting of the cited references in my own words so that they make sense to me, with some supplementary code and extra derivations. Intended as a well broken down introduction to the model, without excessive rigour &mdash; reader beware, it's still rather dense.
